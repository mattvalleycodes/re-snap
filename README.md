# Re-Snap!
Re-Snap! is an implementation of the famous Snap game, implemented using React. In this game, you play against computer. If you're not faimilar with the "Snap" game, have a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngkKM2YwcQc) for an introduction.

## Run Re-snap! locally
To run Re-snap! locally, you need Node 12.6.0 installed and available globally via command line. Clone this repo and run the following commands to get it working locally:

cd re-snap
npm install
npm start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:2020` and enjoy the game!

## Motivations
Initially, I developed "Re-Snap!" as solution for a coding challenge. While working on the solution, I realised that the Snap game is simple yet got some interesting challenges and make it a good project for someone who wants to learn React by doing a project so I decided to open source the solution and let developers who are new to React use it. Re-snap! comes (eventually) with the following solutions:

* Styling an app: Uses CSS (Sass) and BEM methdology to style the app
* Building & Running app: Uses Parcel.js to run & build the app
* Linting: Uses ESLint to lint the codebase
* Formatter: Uses Prettier to format the code
* Composition: Breaks down a big problem into smaller problems and solves the big problem using "Composition" model of React.
* Test: Unit tests the components using Enzyme and Jest

## Bug Reports!
This project is still work in progress so you might encounter issues while playing the game. Please use the "issues" section to report a bug.
